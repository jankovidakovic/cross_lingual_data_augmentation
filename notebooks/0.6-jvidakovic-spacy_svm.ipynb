[and] their commitment to work together for the benefit of all Iraqis,\" said a statement issued from President George W Bush\\'s Texas ranch. \\'Sense of movement\\'\\nIssues under discussion between Iraqi politicians include holding provincial elections and easing a ban on former Baath party members in the civil service and military.\\nAfter the meeting, Mr Maliki appeared at a news conference alongside Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, Sunni Vice-President Tariq al-Hashemi, Shia Vice-President Adel Abdul-Mahdi and Massoud Barzani - president of the Kurdish region.\\nBut nothing suggests that the rebuilding of a broad-based government is necessarily any closer, the BBC\\'s Mike Wooldridge in Baghdad says.\\nMr Hashemi said he had taken part in the talks as vice-president but did not indicate his Iraqi Islamic Party was about to join the moderate Shia-Kurdish alliance. The news conference seemed intended more to give a sense of movement than to convey the substance of significant agreement, our correspondent adds.\\nThe deal has been pushed by the US as a key step on the path to national reconciliation in Iraq.\\n\\nEarlier on Sunday, Mr Maliki hit back at senior US politicians who have called for him to be removed from office, singling out senators Hillary Clinton and Carl Levin. He said the Democratic senators were acting as if Iraq was \"their property\" and that they should \"come to their senses\" and \"respect democracy\". US commander in Iraq, General David Petraeus, and US ambassador Ryan Crocker are expected to report to US Congress in mid-September on progress in Iraq since the troop surge.\\nThe introduction of 30,000 extra troops - completed in mid-June - was supposed give the Iraqi government extra time to make political progress. Mr Maliki said a negative report by Gen Petraeus would not cause him to change course, but he expected the general to \"be supportive of the government\".',\n \"The crisis in Yemen, now in its seventh year of war, continues unabated, with thousands of people displaced and millions “a step away from starvation”, the UN Humanitarian Relief Coordinator said on Wednesday during a high-level side event on the margins of the 76th General Assembly. “The country’s economy has reached new depths of collapse, and a third wave of the pandemic is threatening to crash the country’s already fragile health-care system”, Humanitarian Affairs chief Martin Griffiths told world leaders at the meeting: Yemen: Responding to the crises within the world's largest humanitarian crisis. Underscoring that the most vulnerable always “bear the highest cost” of the crisis, he said that females were more likely to be hungry, sick or exposed to gender-based violence and, with little access to essential services, millions of internally displaced people face “a daily struggle to survive”. In Yemen, conflict has continued to push millions into displacement and starvation.Funding has prevented the worst but without additional support, this critical lifesaving assistance – including food supplies – will have to be reduced in the coming weeks and months. In a positive development, the UN official credited the international community for stepping up support to the country’s humanitarian aid operation. Thanking the world leaders, he said that Yemen’s Humanitarian Response Plan is “among the most well-funded”, with 98 per cent of the pledges made at an event in March fulfilled. With over $2 billion received, the UN and its partners were able to “prevent famine and pull people back from the brink of despair”, delivering assistance to “every single one of the country’s 333 districts”. Despite these important achievements, Mr. Griffiths acknowledged that the work there is “far from done”, as many sectors still face “alarming funding gaps” and humanitarians are working with less than one-fifth of the money needed to provide health care, sanitation, and shelter. “Without additional funding, these and other forms of critical life-saving support – including food assistance – will have to be reduced in the coming weeks and months”, he warned. The UN relief chief asked global leaders to continue generously supporting Yemen’s humanitarian operation; respect international humanitarian law and protect civilians; and address the root drivers of the crisis, including restrictions on imports, which elevate the prices of essential goods. He urged them to do “everything in our collective power to stop this war”, saying, “at the end of the day, peace is what will provide Yemenis the most sustainable form of relief”. The war has robbed too many of Yemen’s children of safety, education and opportunities. “Each day, the violence and destruction wreak havoc on the lives of children and their families”, Henrietta Fore, Executive Director of the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), told the meeting. She painted a grim picture of 1.7 million displaced youth, 11.3 million youngsters depending on humanitarian assistance to survive and 2.3 million under-five “acutely malnourished” – nearly 400,000 of whom are at “imminent risk of death”. “Being a child in Yemen means you have probably either experienced or witnessed horrific violence that no child should ever face”, said the UNICEF chief. “Quite simply, Yemen is one of the most difficult places in the world to be a child”. In his address, World Food Programme (WFP) chief David Beasley said that in a nation of 30 million people, food rations are needed by 12.9 million; while 3.3 million children and women need special nutrition, together with 1.6 million school children. “We’re literally looking at 16 million people marching towards starvation”, he said. With one thousand people a week dying from a lack of food and nutrition, the senior WFP official warned that if $800 million is not received in the next six months, the need to cut rations could lead to the death of 400,000 children under the age of five next year. “We have a moral, obligation, to speak out and step up”, he stated, appealing to the world leaders to “put the pressure on all parties…to end this conflict”. “These are our children; these are our brothers and sisters we need the donors to step up immediately otherwise children are going to die. Let’s not let them down. Let’s do what we need to do”, concluded Mr. Beasley. The complexities of the years-long war in Yemen “multiply as the conflict drags on”, the country’s new UN envoy told the Security Council on Friday, adding that he was “under no illusions about the difficulty of the task” at hand. There has been no let-up in more than six years of conflict in Yemen, as a growing “climate of fear” among civilians continues, a panel of UN-appointed independent rights experts said on Wednesday.\",\n 'Maldives police have used pepper spray to break up a protest about freedom of speech, officials say.\\nAt least 16 of the protesters, who were mostly journalists, were arrested.\\nThe demonstration was against government moves to introduce a new law to criminalise defamation. Observers says it is the latest sign of tension in the Maldives between those calling for greater democratic freedoms and a government increasingly unwilling to allow critics.\\nA week ago, senior journalists in the Indian Ocean archipelago said in a joint statement the bill would \"prevent journalists and citizens from speaking out over serious accusations of corruption and the integrity of state officials\".\\nDemonstrators had gathered outside the office of President Abdulla Yameen in the capital Male on Sunday. They fear that if enacted, the bill would be used against private media and political opponents of the government.

The mines collapsed on Monday night, instantly killing 12 miners, the Geo News reported. The death toll rose after 10 more succumbed to injuries at the District Mohmand Hospital.  Majority of the deceased include labourers and few others who had gathered at the foothill in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Safi town near the Afghanistan border, about 85 km from provincial capital Peshawar.  Mohmand District Police Officer Mohmand Tariq Habib told Geo News that people are still buried under the rubble.  He said the rescue operations were hit due to darkness on Monday night and that heavy machinery had been mobilised on Tuesday for rescue operations.  Deputy Commissioner Iftikhar Alam said the death toll is expected to rise, according to the daily.  Around 45 labourers were busy in excavation operations when the mine collapsed, the Dawn newspaper reported.  The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said nine people have been rescued, it reported.  Rescue Officer Bilal Faizi said most of the injured were in serious condition.  “An operation to rescue those trapped underneath the rubble is currently underway. Five ambulances and one recovery vehicle have been sent to Mohmand from Peshawar,” Dawn News reported, quoting a PDMA statement.  Mohmand district is a tribal agency area. It is famous for its marble reserves.  The rockslide incident brought back memories of a similar mine collapse incident in 2015 in Mohmand which killed 12 labourers.',\n 'Hundreds of whisky and gin bottles found at remains of British army barracks near town of Ramle\\nLast modified on Wed 14 Feb 2018 20.37 GMT\\nArchaeologists have unearthed hundreds of whisky and gin bottles at the remains of a first world war British army barracks in the centre of Israel.\\nThe Israel Antiquities Authority said in a statement that the camp, near the town of Ramle, was used by an expeditionary force under Gen Edmund Allenby for about nine months from November 1917 during a pause in the campaign against the Turkish army in Palestine.\\nThe statement quoted excavation director Ron Toueg as saying the bottles were found among crockery shards and broken cutlery in a rubbish tip.\\n“About 70% of the waste that was discarded in the refuse pit was liquor bottles,” Toueg said. “It seems that the soldiers took advantage of the respite given them to release the tension by frequently drinking alcohol. The discovery of this site and the finds in it provide us with an opportunity for a glimpse of the unwritten part of history, and to reconstruct for the first time the everyday life and leisure of the soldiers.”\\nPictures of the bottles showed several marked as Gordon’s Gin and Dewar’s Whisky.\\nResearcher Brigitte Ouahnouna said it was the first such discovery in Israel. “It is a fascinating testimony of the everyday life of the British military camp a century ago,” the statement quoted her as saying.',\n 'The 1973 Nepal plane hijack (also known as the Biratnagar Plane Hijack) was the first plane hijacking in the history of Nepal. It was architected by Girija Prasad Koirala, to loot the money of Nepal Rastra Bank which was being transported by plane from Biratnagar to Kathmandu. The main motive for this incident was to gather funds for an armed revolution to restore multi-party democracy by overthrowing the party-less Panchayat system headed by the King in Nepal. The aircraft was a DHC-6 Twin Otter (Registration: 9N-ABB) and was delivered to Royal Nepal Airlines in 1971. [1]\\n\\nGirija Prasad Koirala was the main architect of this hijack. He wanted an armed fight for democracy in Nepal, but did not have sufficient funds. He coordinated with another democratic fighter Durga Subedi. Subedi was recently released from prison, where he read about the hijacking of Japan Airlines Flight 351. He came up with the idea of a plane hijack to collect the funds by carrying out a similar hijack. [2][3] They were tipped from Madan Aryal who worked at Nepal Rastra Bank in Biratnagar and knew that the bank would transport Indian currency by plane through Biratnagar. Nagendra Dhungel and Basanta Bhattarai joined the team to hijack the plane. [4]\\n\\nThree crew members and 19 passengers were on board the flight, including actress Mala Sinha. [2]\\n\\nOn 10 June 1973, Nepal Rastra Bank was to transport Indian Rupees from Arrariya, India to Kathmandu via Biratnagar. It was transported to Biratnagar by land and was supposed to be taken to Kathmandu by air. At 8:30 NPT, the 19-seater Royal Nepal Airlines[5] Twin Otter passenger aircraft took off for Kathmandu from Biratnagar. The three hijackers hijacked the within five minutes of take-off. They forced the pilot to land the plane in Forbesganj, Bihar, in a grass field and took 3 million Indian rupees that belonged to the Nepalese government. [6]\\n\\nThe hijackers who boarded the plane were Basanta Bhattarai, Durga Subedi, and Nagendra Prasad Dhungel. Girija Prasad Koirala and Chakra Prasad Bastola were involved in transportation of the loot to Darjeeling. They hid it in the house of B. L. Sharma, an acquaintance of BP Koirala. [7] Ganesh Sharma, an Indian national, arrived with a jeep to the landing site. [6] Other members involved who were at the field in Forbesganj were  Binod Aryal, Sushil Koirala , Manahari Baral, Rajendra Dahal and Biru Lama. Three different vehicles were used in transporting the three boxes of cash to Darjeeling. [6]\\n\\nThe pistols used were illegal and had no license. Two 32 revolvers and one 36 grenade bomb were used. [citation needed]. The plane took off immediately with the passengers after the boxes of cash were taken out. The hijackers went first to Darjeeling, then to Banaras and finally to Mumbai. The hijackers occasionally made trips to New Delhi to meet BP Koirala, the then President of Nepali Congress. However, within a year all hijackers were arrested in India except Nagendra Dhungel. After the 1975 Emergency in India ended, they were released on bail. [6]\\n\\nThe aircraft flew in Nepalese skies for 41 years, before the crash of Nepal Airlines Flight 183 in 2014. The parts of the aircraft were brought to Nepalganj and were put together again and are currently being exhibited in the BP Museum in Sundarijal, Kathmandu. [8][9]\\n\\nIn 2017, a political and historical documentary about this incident titled Hijacking for Democracy was screened at the Nepal Tourism Board in Bhrikutimandap, Kathmandu. [10]\\n\\nIt has been alleged that the money, meant to be used in the struggle for democracy, was misused. BP Koirala himself suspected that the money was misused.

Netanyahu said Wednesday that “nothing justifies” Jews attacking Arabs or Arabs attacking Jews. He vows to restore order after two days of violence unchecked by police. In his words: “It doesn’t matter to me that your blood is boiling. You can’t take the law in your hands.”\\nShortly after he spoke, police reported two people injured in a shooting in the restive city of Lod. Despite large police mobilization under a state of emergency and a nighttime curfew, Lod was the scene of street battles between Jewish and Arab mobs Wednesday night. ___\\nWASHINGTON  U.S. President Joe Biden says that “Israel has a right to defend itself” amid a barrage of rockets fired by Hamas and other Palestinian groups from Gaza. Biden says he spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu amid the dayslong outbreak of violence that has killed dozens. Says Biden: “My expectation and hope is that this will be closing down sooner than later.” He adds, “Israel has a right to defend itself when you have thousands of rockets flying into your territory.”\\nIsrael escalated its air campaign in Gaza on Wednesday, killing a string of senior Hamas military figures as it hammered the Gaza Strip with airstrikes. Militants in the territory fired rocket barrages into Israel. ___\\nMOSCOW  Russia is calling for a quick meeting of international mediators to help defuse the spiraling Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov says it is necessary to call an urgent meeting of the so-called Quartet of mediators, which includes the United States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations. Lavrov made the statement after talking Wednesday with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. Lavrov says a quick ministerial meeting of the Quartet is “the most acute task now.” He voices hope that Guterres can help convene such a meeting. Guterres says “we are totally committed to revitalizing the Quartet.”\\n___\\nUNITED NATIONS  The U.N. relief agency for Palestinian refugees has condemned “in the strongest possible terms” the killing of four children the previous day in an Israeli airstrike on Gaza. UNRWA says the children  two siblings and two cousins  were killed near the refugee camp of Beit Hanoun. It says they were under the age of 12 and went to schools in the territory sponsored by the agency. Wednesday’s statement says: “Our hearts go out to their families and friends in communities that have been so cruelly affected by this latest escalation.”\\nUNRWA provides critical services to more than 1.4 million Palestine refugees in Gaza and delivers education to some 285,000 Palestine refugee students there. The statement also repeated profound concern regarding the impact of the military escalation on children by placing their lives and futures at risk. The escalation between Israel and Gaza this week has killed 65 Palestinians in Gaza, including 16 children and five women. Seven people have been killed on the Israeli side by rocket fire from Gaza, including a 6-year old and an Israeli soldier, the first military death in this round of conflict. ___\\nTEL AVIV, Israel  A large crowd of ultranationalist Israelis have attacked a car in a Tel Aviv suburb they suspected was driven by an Arab, dragging the driver out of the car and beating him. A video from the scene on Wednesday shows the driver trying to maneuver the vehicle to flee the scene but colliding into two other vehicles. He is then pulled from the vehicle and beaten. TV footage from the scene showed the driver motionless on the ground. A doctor at Tel Aviv’s Ichilov hospital says the driver is hospitalized with serious injuries. Dr. Eyal Hashiva told reporters he suffered major trauma to his entire body but was in stable condition. However, the suburb of Bat Yam’s Deputy Mayor Eyal Yariv told Channel 12 that police did not respond to city hall’s calls for assistance. Police said they deployed forces along the city’s border with Jaffa to prevent the mob from entering the Arab neighborhood. Violent unrest has involved Jewish and Arab throngs in Lod, Acre, and Tiberias since the latest escalation between Israel and the Palestinians erupted this week. Also on Wednesday, a crowd of around 100 Jewish protesters marched down Jaffa Street in central Jerusalem, chanting “death to Arabs.”\\nAnd in the northern city of Acre, an Arab mob attacked and critically injured a Jewish man. Paramedics said the ambulance was also attacked by the crowd en route to a hospital. ___\\nUNITED NATIONS  The U.N. Mideast envoy has told the Security Council the current violence is “the most serious escalation between Israel and Palestinian militants in years. Diplomats say Tor Wennesland is worried it could erupt into a civil war. He briefed the council on Wednesday behind closed doors  for the second time in three days  on the deteriorating situation on the ground but the U.N.’s most powerful body again took no action. Diplomats said China, Tunisia and Norway, who called the meeting, wanted the council to issue a press statement but the United States objected. The diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity because the consultations were private. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters that Wennesland expressed concern over the growing number of civilian casualties in both Gaza and Israel, and sadness at the death of children in Gaza. Dujarric said the U.N. chief, Antonio Guterres, and Wennesland have both reiterated that “indiscriminate launching of rockets and mortars from highly populated civilian neighborhoods towards civilian population centers violates international humanitarian law.”\\nWennesland recognizes Israel’s legitimate security concerns but reiterated that “Israeli security forces should exercise maximum restraint, calibrate their use of force to spare civilians and civilian objects in the conduct of military operations.” Four European council members  France, Estonia, Ireland and Norway  issued a statement after the council meeting urgently calling on both sides “to de-escalate tensions, end violence and show the utmost restraint.” They condemned the firing of rockets from Gaza into Israel and called civilian casualties on both sides “worrying and unacceptable.”\\n Edith M. Lederer at the United Nations\\n___\\nWASHINGTON  U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken has called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reaffirm America’s support for Israel’s right to defend itself from Hamas rocket attacks from Gaza. Blinken spoke on Wednesday with the Israeli leader. The State Department said he also repeated U.S. calls for a de-escalation of violence and the Biden administration’s belief that both Israelis and Palestinians have the right to live in safety and security. Blinken announced earlier he was sending a senior diplomat to the region to make similar appeals in person to Israeli and Palestinian officials. He also said that Israel had an “extra burden” to avoid civilian casualties as it responds to the attacks. According to the State Department, Blinken also told Netanyahu that as he and President Joe Biden have said in the past, the administration believes Israelis and Palestinians should “enjoy equal measures of freedom, security, prosperity, and democracy.”\\n___\\nGAZA CITY, Gaza Strip  Israeli fighter jets have dropped two bombs on a 14-story building in Gaza City and destroyed it. The building housed businesses as well as offices for Hamas’ Al-Aqsa satellite TV channel. It was located in the old Roman neighborhood, on the busiest shopping street in Gaza. Hamas says it has fired 130 rockets toward Israel in response for the attack on Wednesday. The Israeli airstrike was the latest in a series of assaults on targets in the Gaza Strip after a long dispute between Israel and Hamas erupted into an exchange of rocket attacks from Gaza and Israeli retaliation. The building is the third multistory structure that Israeli aircraft have hit directly, reducing two to rubble. The third is still standing but in irreparable condition. -\\nWASHINGTON  U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Israel bears an “extra burden” to avoid civilian casualties as it responds to rocket attacks from Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip. Blinken says Israel has an “absolute” right to defend itself and its citizens from militant attacks but that it must take all possible steps to protect innocent Palestinians. He said on Wednesday that Israel should “do everything it possibly can to avoid civilian casualties even as it is rightfully responding in defense of its people.”\\nBlinken made the comments after announcing that he is sending a senior U.S. diplomat to the Middle East to press Israeli and Palestinians officials both to de-escalate the tensions and violence that now verge on war. Blinken condemned the Hamas rocket attacks and stressed that both Israelis and Palestinians have a right to live in peace and security. ___\\nWASHINGTON  U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says he’s sending a senior American diplomat to the Middle East to urge Israeli and Palestinian officials to de-escalate the conflict threatening to erupt into a new war. Blinken told reporters on Wednesday he had instructed Hady Amr, the deputy secretary of state for Israel and Palestinian affairs, to travel immediately to the region. The move comes as the situation deteriorates with intensified rocket attacks on Israel from Hamas militants and Israeli retaliation. Amr is the most senior U.S. diplomat tasked with the matter. He served as deputy Middle East peace envoy during the Obama administration. Blinken did not say who Amr would meet with or how long his mission would last. The Biden administration has been criticized by both sides as well as by lawmakers for not doing enough to try to stop the violence. Blinken said the administration is “very focused” on the matter and remains committed to a two-state resolution to end the decades-long conflict. ___\\nJERUSALEM Israeli police are imposing a nighttime curfew on a central city that was the scene of unrest in recent days. Police said in a statement on Wednesday that officers would enforce the ban on people entering the city of Lod, residents leaving their homes, and people in public spaces starting at 8 p.m.\\nLod has seen two nights of violent protests, including the torching of dozens of vehicles, a synagogue, and violent clashes between Arab protesters and police. Israeli authorities declared a state of emergency in the city and deployed Border Police forces. ___\\nBELGRADE, Serbia  Dozens of Palestinians living in Belgrade have staged a protest in the Serbian capital over an escalation in fighting in the Gaza Strip in recent days. The protesters on Wednesday gathered at Belgrade’s Republic Square to draw public attention to the conflict that has surged after weeks of violence in Jerusalem. The protesters carried banners reading “Gaza needs our voices now,” and, “Freedom!” The latest Mideast fighting is rooted in a long dispute over contested Jerusalem. After Hamas rained rockets inside Israel on Monday, the conflict suddenly erupted and now increasingly resembles the 2014 Gaza war. ___\\nGAZA CITY, Gaza Strip  Palestinian militant group Hamas has confirmed that its Gaza City commander was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Wednesday. Bassem Issa was the highest-ranking military figure in Hamas to be killed Israel since 2014. Wednesday’s statement was the first time Hamas acknowledged the death of militants in this round of fighting with Israel. The armed wing of Hamas said Issa was killed “along with a few of his fellow brothers of leaders and holy fighters” during the fighting that has been going on for two days in Gaza. Israel’s internal security agency said a series of airstrikes had killed Issa and several other senior Hamas militants, including the head of rocket development and cyber warfare, the head of rocket production, and the Hamas engineering chief. Issa and several other commanders responsible for the different districts of the Gaza Strip formed Hamas’ military council, the highest body deciding on the group’s militant operations. The military council is headed by Mohammed Deif. ___\\nLONDON  Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he wants to see an “urgent de-escalation of tensions” between Israel and Hamas amid the most severe outbreak of violence since the 2014 Gaza war. Johnson tweeted on Wednesday that the United Kingdom is “deeply concerned” and urged leaders to “step back from the brink.” He was one of many leaders around the world offering up advice after longtime tensions in contested Jerusalem erupted into rocket-fire from the Gaza Strip and an intense response from Israel. British Foreign Office Minister James Cleverly told Parliament that Britain “unequivocally condemns the firing of rockets at Jerusalem and other locations in Israel.” He called Hamas’ conduct “terrorism” and called on militants to “end their incitement and rocket fire against Israel.”\\nCleverly said Israel has a “legitimate right to self-defense,” but added that in doing so, ”it is vital that all actions are proportionate, in line with international humanitarian law and make every effort to avoid civilian casualties.”\\n___\\nJERUSALEM  Israel’s firefighting service says it has almost completely extinguished a blaze at a petroleum facility in southern Israel that was set alight by a rocket fired by Hamas militants. The rocket landed Tuesday night near a Petroleum and Energy Infrastructures Ltd. facility south of Ashkelon during a major barrage by Gaza militants. The result was a massive fire in a storage tank that blazed through the night and into Wednesday. Israel Fire and Rescue Services said that 20 teams have been working for 25 hours to extinguish the inferno that issued a column of thick black smoke. Israeli state-owned Petroleum and Energy Infrastructures said the fuel had been transferred to another storage facility. On Wednesday, the plume of smoke was still rising over Ashkelon. Israeli health and environment officials have instructed residents of the area to avoid prolonged periods outdoors. ___\\nJERUSALEM  Israel’s president says the country’s Arab leaders are “giving support to terrorism and rioting” by staying quiet about an outbreak unrest in mixed communities. Reuven Rivlin said on Wednesday that the “silence of the Arab leadership” over violence in mixed Jewish-Arab communities amounts to “encouraging the rupture of the society” amid the most severe outbreak of violence since the 2014 Gaza war. Rivlin says Israel “must pursue the rioters with a firm hand (to) restore security and order to all of us, also while fighting terrorism from Gaza without compromise.”\\nThe unrest that began at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem has spread across Israel itself. It comes after Hamas called for a full-scale Palestinian intifada, or uprising. In the Israeli city of Lod, a 52-year-old Arab Israeli and his 16-year-old daughter were killed early Wednesday when a rocket landed in the courtyard of their one-story home. Lod also saw heavy clashes after thousands of mourners joined a funeral for an Arab man who was killed the previous night, the suspect a Jewish gunman. Israeli media reported that the crowd fought with police, and set a synagogue and some 30 vehicles on fire. ___\\nJERUSALEM  The Israeli military says it has killed several senior Hamas militant commanders in airstrikes in Gaza and Khan Younis. The army released a statement on Wednesday, saying that it carried out a “complex and first-of-its-kind operation.” Those targeted, it said, were “a key part of the Hamas ‘General Staff’” and considered close to the head of the group’s military wing. Hamas had no comment. ___\\nJERUSALEM  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel will use “an iron fist if needed” to stop widespread protests by Arab citizens that have resulted in injuries, arrests, and property damage. Netanyahu said on Wednesday that Israel will “stop the anarchy” after deploying Border Police forces to calm unrest in recent days in the cities of Lod and Acre. The mounting unrest comes after weeks of violence in Jerusalem and heavy fighting between Israel and Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip in recent days. The fighting is rooted in a long dispute over contested Jerusalem. After Hamas rained rockets inside Israel on Monday, the conflict suddenly erupted and increasingly resembles the 2014 Gaza war. Netayahu says Israel will “stop the anarchy and restore governance to the cities of Israel, with an iron fist if needed, with all forces needed and all authorities required.”\\n___\\nBERLIN  Germany is standing by Israel during the most intense fighting since the 2014 Gaza war. Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht on Wednesday condemned the rocket attacks on Israel from Gaza, saying Germany is standing “strongly on the side of Israel.” She called for the attacks on Israel to stop, adding that Israel has the right to protect itself.”\\nLambrecht also denounced anti-Semitic acts near synagogues in Germany. She said a spate of Israeli flag-burning and other acts at a time of “agony” for Israel shows “nothing but horrible disrespect for human dignity.” German news agency dpa reported that police stopped 13 suspects late Tuesday in the western city of Muenster near a synagogue after an Israeli flag was burned there. Police said that in the western city of Bonn, several people damaged the entrance of a synagogue with stones. Investigators found a burned flag there as well. And in nearby Duesseldorf, somebody burned garbage on top of a memorial for a former synagogue. The justice minister vowed that “the perpetrators must be found and held responsible and Jewish institutions must be protected thoroughly.”\\n___\\nANKARA, Turkey  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has told Russian President Vladimir Putin that the international community should “give Israel a strong and deterrent lesson” over its conduct toward the Palestinians. That’s according to the Turkish Presidential Communications Directorate, which said the two leaders talked by phone on Wednesday about the escalating confrontation sparked by tension over contested Jerusalem. The statement said Erdogan stressed the need for “the international community to give Israel a strong and deterrent lesson” and pressed for the U.N. Security Council to rapidly intervene with “determined and clear messages” to Israel. The statement said Erdogan suggested to Putin that an international protection force to shield the Palestinians should be considered. Meanwhile, thousands of people in Istanbul defied a nationwide coronavirus curfew late on Tuesday to demonstrate against Israel’s attacks. A large convoy of cars drove toward the Israeli Consulate, waving Turkish and Palestinian flags. An image of the Palestinian and Turkish flags was projected onto the Israeli building. ___\\nISLAMABAD, Pakistan  Pakistan has condemned Israel’s actions and called for Muslim nations to stand by the Palestinians. Prime Minister Imran Khan took to Twitter, saying: “We stand with Gaza and Palestine.”\\nForeign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi meanwhile urged Muslim nations to unite over Israel’s strikes on Palestinian civilian areas. Protesters are expected to hold a small anti-Israel rally later today in the southern city of Karachi. ___\\nGAZA CITY, Gaza Strip  The Gaza Health Ministry says the death toll from Israeli airstrikes on Gaza has climbed to 43, including 13 children and three women. It says nearly 300 Palestinians in the territory have been wounded in the strikes. The strikes began on Monday after Palestinians launched a barrage of rockets into Israel. The worst fighting since the 2014 Gaza war was ignited by clashes in Jerusalem in recent weeks between Palestinian protesters and Israeli police focused on the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, a site sacred to Jews and Muslims.',\n '\\n\\nThe 2007–2008 Cork players\\' strike was a dispute in Republic of Ireland between the Cork County Board and its Gaelic footballers and hurlers. It led to the footballers and hurlers refusing to play for the Cork County Board. The cause of the strike was the issue of deciding who should pick the senior teams\\' selectors. [1] The players believed the manager should pick the selectors. However, the county board picked the selectors. With the appointment of Teddy Holland as manager, the players also refused to play under his tutorship since he accepted the job during their time of strike. [2]\\n\\nThe strike drew comment from the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern,[3] and was the first time in the history of the Gaelic Athletic Association that a strike caused inter county fixtures not to be played. [4]\\n\\nThe strike was the second strike by Cork players in five years. It began on 10 December 2007[5] and ended on 18 February 2008[4][6] – 97 days after the first threat of strike action[7] – and was declared over on 15 February 2008. [8] However Holland was not fired until 18 February. [9][10] Kieran Mulvey, chairman of the Labour Relations Commission, acted as arbitrator between the players and county board. On 10 December, the players officially went on strike. [19][20] The county board and the players held the first of a series of meetings to try resolve the strike ten days later. [21] On 9 January, the hurlers confirmed they would not play in the Waterford Crystal Cup and the county was forced to give a walkover to Limerick IT. [22]\\n\\nLater in the month (23 January), Teddy Holland issued a press statement announcing he would not resign. [23] More than 100 club delegates voted unanimously in support of Holland at a county board meeting held on 30 January. [24] Three days earlier (27 January), in a bid to resolve their issues, the players and the county board had held 18 hours of talks, chaired by Kieran Mulvey, which ended in stalemate. [25] Mulvey had been asked to chair the talks by Nickey Brennan, the President of the Gaelic Athletic Association. [26]\\n\\nIn the week leading up to the National Football League game against Meath, the Cork county board were unable to guarantee a team would be available to play the game. Consequently, on 30 January the game was postponed. [27] The Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, called on both sides to resolve the dispute[3] on 5 February and further talks between Kieran Mulvey and Paraic Duffy, the Director General of the GAA, were held. [28]\\n\\nOn 7 February the players refused a solution offered by the county board and it looked likely that Cork would be removed from both the National Hurling League and National Football League[29] and be relegated for the following season. It was claimed that under GAA rules that if a team was unable to take part in two league games that they should be disqualified from the league. [30][31][32] A second football match was to be played on 16 February[33] while the second hurling game was due on 17 February. [34]\\n\\nOn 8 February, the Cork players reacted negatively to what they thought was an attempt by the county board to split the footballers and hurlers[35] when a press release claimed the players would accept Holland as manager. [36] The following day Roy Keane compared the 2002 strike to the Saipan incident and warned about players becoming too powerful. [37] A poll showed that 56 percent of fans supported the strike and 70 percent believed the actions of the board damaged Cork\\'s chance of winning All-Ireland championships that year. [38]\\n\\nThe Cork county board, on 12 February, voted 96–13 in favour of entering binding arbitration with the players in a bid to save the teams being disqualified from the leagues[39][40] and Nickey Brennan called for the dispute to end, \"however it is achieved. \"[41] On 14 February, the players met with Mulvey and agreed to accept the arbitration in an attempt to end the strike, then in its 95th day. [42]\\n\\nThe outcome of arbitration on 15 February was as follows:\\n\\nMany newspapers[44][45][46] declared the strike over on 15 February after the players accepted the outcome of the arbitration and also declared that Teddy Holland had resigned. However, the GAA confirmed that the Cork-versus-Dublin football and Cork-versus-Waterford hurling games that were due to take place were to be called off. [46][47]\\n\\nThe county board called an emergency meeting to discuss the recommendations of the arbitration and especially the recommendation from Mulvey that Holland should resign. [48] By 16 February, uncertainty had emerged over the status of the strike. [49][50] While the county board and Holland met to discuss the issues,[51] an expected vote by the county board to remove Holland was never called. [52] Holland meanwhile issued a statement that didn\\'t indicate if he had stepped down and stated that he was neutral saying: I am my own man and I am proud to be a Cork football man. Holland said the claim that six people had refused the job before him was false and there was no threat of strike when he took the job. [53] However, a statement in support of the strike had been issued by the Gaelic Players Association on 13 November 2007, a week before Holland took the job. On 17 February it was clear Holland had not resigned or been fired by the county board and that the strike continued. [9][52] The county board issued a statement saying that they would meet on Monday 18 February to end the strike. [54] The strike officially ended on 18 February – 97 days after the first threat of strike –[7] when, as expected,[55][56] the county board voted 89–19 to fire Teddy Holland and his selectors, who refused to step down. [4][15]\\n\\nThe seven-man panel appointed to help find the next manager began its search as soon as Holland had been removed, and included players Nicholas Murphy and Derek Kavanagh. [4][57] Conor Counihan was appointed Cork\\'s new football manager[58] with the right to name his own selectors. [59] On 20 February, Seán Óg Ó hAilpín said that, had the strike carried on beyond 18 February, he and others would have resigned from inter-county hurling and football. [60] Cork Under 21 footballer, Sean Cahalane, claimed that the Under 21 panel would not have played in place of the seniors if they had been asked by the county board. [61]\\n\\nOn 19 February, the Central Competitions Control Committee (CCCC) decided not to remove Cork from the football and hurling leagues, but instead awarded the points from the missed games to their opponents and fined the county board €400 for each game missed. [62] Kilkenny county board offered to play their hurling match with Cork and the Cork county board requested CCCC approve the game. [63][64][65] However the CCCC had already awarded Kilkenny the point and would not allow the game to take place. It emerged that Cork couldn\\'t have been removed from the leagues as there was no such rule. [66]\\n\\nCork went on to win their first football and hurling matches after the strike, beating Dublin\\'s hurlers 2–16 to 3–18[67][68] and Roscommon\\'s footballers 0–15 to 1–14[69] However, the decision to award the teams that Cork did not play victory points had a knock-on effect for other teams in both leagues. Roscommon[70] and Wexford[71] both lodged unsuccessful appeals against the decision.']"
